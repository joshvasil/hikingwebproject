<h1>Cumberland Island Trails</h1>
<p>Cumberland Island National Seashore preserves most of Cumberland Island in Camden County, Georgia, the largest of Georgia's Golden Isles. The seashore features beaches and dunes, marshes, and freshwater lakes. The national seashore also preserves and interprets many historic sites and structures.

Instrumental in the creation and preservation of the seashore were several conservation organizations including the Sierra Club and the Georgia Conservancy.</p>

<p>The island’s wild beauty is abundant. Giant live oaks twist and gnarl toward the bright blue sky, with tiny green leaves draped in smoky, wispy Spanish moss swaying gently in the breeze. Sunlight shimmers down through the forest canopy, catching in the moss like a veil and casting ever-changing patterns of shade and light on the forest floor. The island’s vegetation is lush, and alternates between fan-shaped saw palmetto plants and live oak forest, to groves of coastal pine and open, golden grasslands.</p>
<p>The island’s windswept coastline and maritime forests offer more than fifty miles of nearly-level, sandy trails. Explore the island’s southern trails, hiking to serene, wide, powdery beaches and Dungeness, the ruins of a Carnegie family mansion.Waves gently lap the island’s wide, powdery beaches, rolling conch shells and sand dollars onto the shore. Large horseshoe crab shells scatter among foggy, sand-pitted clusters of colorful sea glass and occasional intact antique bottles. Giant wooden beams and rusted metal dot the beaches, fragments of old boats and shipwrecks. Wild horses frequent the dunes lining the shore, grazing on sea oats in small herds, and shorebirds take flight above the island’s warm-water shallows, soaring in the beach breezes.</p>
