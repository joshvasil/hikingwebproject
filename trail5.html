<p>These top Kennesaw Mountain trails vary in difficulty and in length, and they’re all uniquely different and fully worthy of a day hike or trail run. Catch views of the Atlanta city skyline from the mountain’s summits, visit Civil War memorials and monuments, and trek through gently rolling, stream-filled forests. Wherever your adventures take you, please help preserve the history and beauty of the mountain’s trails, battlefields, and summits. Please pack out everything you pack in, leave no trace, and don’t walk or climb on historic earthworks or cannons.</p>
